      "description": "A new version of the Atomic macOS info-stealer (AMOS) has been discovered with an embedded backdoor that allows attackers persistent, remote access to compromised systems by executing arbitrary commands, surviving reboots, and maintaining long-term control. The malware targets macOS files, cryptocurrency extensions, and user passwords and uses LaunchDaemons and hidden scripts ('.helper' and '.agent') to ensure persistence, leveraging stolen user credentials to install components with superuser privileges. Active campaigns have impacted over 120 countries, with the United States, France, Italy, the United Kingdom, and Canada among the most affected, and a large-scale September 2024 operation linked to the cybercrime group 'Marko Polo' targeting Apple computers. Recent distribution has shifted from cracked software sites to more targeted phishing at cryptocurrency owners and freelancers. The backdoor enables remote command execution, keystroke logging, additional payload delivery, and supports evasion techniques such as sandbox and VM checks with obfuscated strings. ",
